# Student-Report--Card-Generator
Here is a smart student report card generator program helpful for teachers.
🏫 Student Report Card Generator
📝 Overview

The Student Report Card Generator is a Python-based program that allows teachers or users to enter a student’s details and subject-wise marks to automatically generate a detailed report card. The program calculates the total, average, and final grade based on performance, providing a quick and easy way to evaluate students.

📦 Features

Student Details: Stores student name and roll number.

Subject Marks: Allows entering marks for 5 subjects (custom subject names).

Automatic Calculation: Computes total marks, average score, and grade.

Grading System: Assigns grades (A+ to F) based on average marks.

Report Card Output: Displays a neat summary with all details.

🚀 How It Works

Run the script in Python.

Enter:

Student name

Roll number

Subject names and marks (for 5 subjects)

The program calculates:

Total marks

Average score

Grade (using a grading scale).

The report card is printed on the terminal.

💡 Example Workflow

Enter student name → “Rahul”

Enter roll number → 102

Enter 5 subjects and their marks → (Math: 88, English: 75, Science: 92, History: 64, Computer: 85)

The program outputs:

    Student report card
Student name : Rahul
Marks : {'Math': 88, 'English': 75, 'Science': 92, 'History': 64, 'Computer': 85}
Roll no : 102
Total : 404
Average : 80.8
Grade : A

⚙️ Requirements

Python 3.x

No external libraries required (runs directly in terminal).
